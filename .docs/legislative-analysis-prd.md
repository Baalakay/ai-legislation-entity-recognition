# Product Requirements Document: Legislative Document Analysis System

## Overview
The Legislative Document Analysis System is an AI-powered solution designed to automate the analysis of legislation and ordinance documents. The system extracts key metadata and determines whether updates to existing legislative Code are required, providing a structured output for Code maintenance workers.

## Problem Statement
Currently, analyzing legislative documents to determine Code update requirements is a manual, time-consuming process performed by specialized workers. This process involves:
- Reviewing legislation documents in various formats from different jurisdictions
- Identifying key metadata (legislation type, number, adoption date)
- Determining if and how the legislation affects the Code
- Extracting affected chapters, sections, and the nature of changes
- Creating a summary for Code maintenance workers

This manual process is labor-intensive, prone to human error, and creates bottlenecks in Code maintenance workflows.

## Project Goals
1. Automate the extraction of key metadata from legislative documents
2. Accurately determine if a document requires updates to the existing legislative Code
3. Identify the specific nature of changes required (Add, Amend, Repeal)
4. Flag Non-Code Material (NCM) with appropriate categorization
5. Create a structured output that summarizes all required Code changes
6. Identify special instances requiring additional processing

## User Personas
**Code Maintenance Worker**:
- Legal professional responsible for updating municipal/state codes
- Needs clear information about what changes need to be made where
- Works with many different document formats and jurisdictions

**System Administrator**:
- Manages the system processing legislative documents
- Needs to monitor performance and handle exceptions
- Requires visibility into processing status and quality

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Document Processing
- System must accept PDF legislation documents
- System must process documents from various jurisdictions with different formats
- System must handle documents with multiple disposition actions
- System must identify standard patterns of legislative language

#### Data Extraction
The system must extract the following data points from each document:
- **Legislation Type** (Ordinance, Ord. No., Local Law, Resolution, etc.)
- **Legislation Number** (in various formats like 123, 1-2024, 2024-1, etc.)
- **Adoption Date** (when legislation was enacted/passed)
- **Long Title** (descriptive title of the legislation)
- **Disposition** (what action is being taken and on which sections)
  - ADD: Identification of new chapters/titles/articles/sections being added
  - AMEND: Identification of existing chapters/titles/articles/sections being modified
  - REPEAL: Identification of chapters/titles/articles/sections being removed
  - NCM (Non-Code Material): Categorization using standardized shortcuts

#### Special Instance Detection
The system must identify special instances that may affect processing:
- **E-1**: Nomenclature changes throughout the Code
- **E-2**: Old text and new text both recited in the law
- **E-3**: Redline text (underlined, struck through, highlighted)
- **E-4**: Text in all caps
- **E-5**: Appendix drawings
- **E-6**: Large appendixes
- **E-7**: Text on legal-size pages
- **P-1**: Multiple laws combined requiring splitting
- **P-2**: Missing attachments
- **P-3**: Additional non-ordinance material
- **P-4**: Every other page blank or missing

#### Output Generation
- System must generate a structured CSV output
- Output must include all extracted metadata and dispositions
- For documents with multiple dispositions, each must be listed separately
- System must flag documents requiring manual review

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- System must process a single document in under 2 minutes
- System must handle batch processing of multiple documents

#### Accuracy
- System must achieve 85%+ accuracy in metadata extraction
- System must achieve 80%+ accuracy in disposition identification

#### Scalability
- System must handle varying document sizes and complexity
- System must be able to process documents from different jurisdictions

#### Security
- System must comply with data privacy requirements
- System must not store sensitive document content beyond processing period

## Dependencies
1. **Input Format**: System requires PDF-formatted legislation documents
2. **Training Data**: Sample documents with known outputs for each disposition type
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Predefined patterns of legislative language for each jurisdiction/state
4. **Output Format**: CSV format as defined in the Index file

## Success Metrics
1. **Accuracy Rate**: Percentage of correctly extracted metadata fields
2. **Disposition Identification Rate**: Percentage of correctly identified dispositions
3. **Processing Time**: Average time to fully process a single document
4. **Manual Review Rate**: Percentage of documents requiring human review
5. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback from Code maintenance workers on system utility

## Limitations & Constraints
- System will not process certain document types (MA towns, CT/NH/ME Town Meetings, Tribes, MD counties)
- System will not extract the full text content of amendments/additions
- Initial version focuses on metadata extraction rather than full content analysis
- Some documents will still require manual review due to complexity or uniqueness

## Timeline
1. **Phase 1**: Development of AI model for document analysis
2. **Phase 2**: Training with sample documents
3. **Phase 3**: Testing against validation set
4. **Phase 4**: Refinement based on test results
5. **Phase 5**: Deployment and integration

## Future Enhancements
- Extract Article/Chapter level details (second level)
- Improve handling of edge cases
- Add support for additional document formats
- Implement continuous learning to improve accuracy over time
- Develop jurisdiction-specific processing rules
