# Project Progress

## Current State
- START phase is complete.
- Memory bank is fully initialized with project brief, technology context, architecture, scaffolding, and environment setup.
- Project is running in a standard devcontainer.

## What Works
- All core requirements, goals, and constraints are documented.
- Technology stack and architecture are defined and recorded.
- Directory structure and environment setup are established for PoC.
- Data sources, training/testing data, and output schema are referenced in memory.

## Next Steps
- Transition to DEVELOPMENT phase using the RIPER workflow.
- Begin implementation of backend and frontend scaffolding.
- Integrate AI extraction logic for direct PDF processing.
- Set up CSV output generation and minimal UI for uploads/results.
